# LLM Application with LangChain & LangSmith

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a simple LLM (Large Language Model) application using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/). It demonstrates how to design a prompt template, integrate a language model, and monitor performance and debugging insights using LangSmith observability tools.

## ðŸ§  What This Project Does

- Uses LangChain to create a simple language model application.
- Constructs a custom prompt template to guide model output.
- Leverages LangSmith for real-time tracing, observability, and debugging.
- Wraps everything in a reproducible Jupyter Notebook (`LanguageChatbot.ipynb`).

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `LanguageChatbot.ipynb`: The main notebook that builds and runs the application step-by-step.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions for this project.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-app-framework.git
   cd llm-app-framework
