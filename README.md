# LLM Application with LangChain & LangSmith

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a simple LLM (Large Language Model) application using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/). It demonstrates how to design a prompt template, integrate a language model, and monitor performance and debugging insights using LangSmith observability tools.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Uses LangChain to create a simple language model application.
- Constructs a custom prompt template to guide model output.
- Leverages LangSmith for real-time tracing, observability, and debugging.
- Wraps everything in a reproducible Jupyter Notebook (`LanguageChatbot.ipynb`).

## 📂 Files

- `LanguageChatbot.ipynb`: The main notebook that builds and runs the application step-by-step.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions for this project.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-app-framework.git
   cd llm-app-framework

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- LangChain  
- LangSmith  
- OpenAI API (or other LLM provider)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📈 Observability with LangSmith

LangSmith is integrated into this project to provide visibility into prompt performance, model outputs, and errors. Traces can be viewed in the LangSmith dashboard for improved debugging and refinement.
